							<h2 style="margin-left: 10px;">I worked for McDonalds for 5
								years, 2 of which were as a manager. I was in charge of: running
								shifts, ensuring the tasks that were given to me were properly
								delegated to my staff, and that the customer received the best
								experience possible. I moved on to a country club where I worked
								as a banquet coordinator for about two years. I ensured that
								weddings and banquets ran smoothly. I would delegate tasks to my
								team members to ensure that the service was kept on a tight
								time schedule. For example, if the cake cutting was at 6:30 p.m.,
								it was my duty to make sure everything was in place no later than
								15 minutes before hand. After working at the country club, I
								moved into the private investigating field where I worked for a
								year. While there, I was in charge of scheduling out video that
								needed to be watched in a timely manner, creating and maintaining
								spreadsheets that optimized growth in the department, and typed
								reports that were sent to insurance adjusters. In February 2016,
								I went into the insurance field to help people. I would change
								people's lives by being friendly and knowledgeable about the
								products Bankers Life offered. An insurance agent must have good
								time management skills,knowledge of the products, and an
								entrepreneur mind set. Due to my hard work ethics, I have
								excelled in every entry level position that I have held. This and
								my ability to learn quickly lead to promotions</h2>
